Creating a Pull Request Please follow best practices for creating git commits.

We only seek to accept code that you are authorized to contribute to the project. We have added a pull request template on our projects so that your contributions are made with the following confirmation:

> I confirm that this contribution is made under the terms of the license found in the root directory of this repository's source tree and that I have the authority necessary to make this contribution on behalf of its copyright owner.

#### Creating a Pull Request

Please follow [best practices](https://github.com/trein/dev-best-practices/wiki/Git-Commit-Best-Practices) for creating git commits.

We also ask you to use the following guidelines:
  1.  Make sure your code respects existing formatting conventions. In general, follow the same coding style as the code that you are modifying.
  2.  Do add/update documentation appropriately for the change you are making.
  3.  Bugfixes should include a unit test or integration test reproducing the issue.
  4.  Do not use author tags/information in the code.
  5.  Always include license header on each file your create.
  6.  Try to keep pull requests short and submit separate ones for unrelated features, but feel free to combine simple bugfixes/tests into one pull request.
  7.  Keep the number of commits small and combine commits for related changes. Each commit should compile on its own and ideally pass tests.
  8.  Keep formatting changes in separate commits to make code reviews easier and distinguish them from actual code changes.

When your code is ready to be submitted, you can [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) to begin the code review process.
